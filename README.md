## Assignment Suggestions
I think something you could do if this was made to be an official assignment in include more explicit instructions on what students should do for the test cases. Either that or provide test casse and have the assignment in one singular coding language. Another idea would be to use another testing framework, similar to how we did in the React test cases assignment. I think that could be good because it would build on students' base knowledge of unit testing suites. Furthermore, if the test cases were provided then you could have students make more functions to utilize the database setup.
